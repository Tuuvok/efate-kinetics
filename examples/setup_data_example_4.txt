#    1. Select model type

#    Valid model types:
#       SFO
#       DFOP
#       SFO-SFO
#       DFOP-SFO

model_type = DFOP-SFO



#    2. Select starting parameters for fitting

#    Set parameters not relvant for model to NA.

#    initial concentration of parent
Cp0 = 100

#    degradation rate of parent compartment
kp = NA

#    degradation rate of parent compartment 1
kp1 = 0.1

#    degradation rate of parent compartment 2
kp2 = 0.2

#    fraction of Cp0 applied to compartment 1
g = 0.5

#    degradation rate of metabolite
km = 0.05

#    formation rate of metabolite
kfm = 0.5



#    3. Select control data

#    Keep defaults if uncertain.

#    convergence tolerance for the residual sum of squares
ftol = 1E-10

#    parameter tolerance for convergence
ptol = 1E-10

#    gradient tolerance for convergence
gtol = 1E-10

#    minimum step size factor allowed during the iterations
factor = 100

#    maximum number of iterations
maxiter = 200
